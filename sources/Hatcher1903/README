You're welcome -- happy to contribute. 

I read it as "R. Weber, del." I didn't know what the "del." meant, but the Haplo vertebra plates have "SYDNEY PRENTICE, DEL." so I figured it was to indicate the artist. Sure enough, it's short for the Latin "delineavit", meaning "he/she drew it". https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/delineavit#f
