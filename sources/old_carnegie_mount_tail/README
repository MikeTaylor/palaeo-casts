Subject: Carnegie mount photos

Hi Mike,

Here are the photos of the old Carnegie mount I mentioned. They were shared with me by Ken Carpenter but I'm not sure whether he took them originally (they came along with some other photos that I'm pretty sure were taken by others). Specifically, the photo CM-84 (8) is the one that shows the part of the sequence that the vertebra currently mounted as caudal 31 is missing from.

I'm going to be visiting the Carnegie Museum next week, and examining the caudals of CM 94 is one of my top priorities. If you can think of anything I should keep an eye out for, let me know. Perhaps it would be useful for us to compare notes at some point after I've seen the specimen?

Regards,
John
