The rear of the photo holds a press clipping reading as follows:

THE HEAD BONE CONNECTED TO ...
Arthur Pugh of the Houston Museum consultant firm bearing his name holds the first cast of a dinosaur head made from moulds he has acquired. The molds, made from a dinosaur skeleton found in 1903, will be used to cast a skeleton replica for the Houston Museum of Natural Science. Also to be used in the reconstruction are 65 bones now owned by the museum. The whole skeleton contains 627 bones. Pugh estimates it will take 18 months to two years to complete the project. He first plans to cast a skeleton for the Rocky Mount, N.C.., museum.

The clipping includes the bottom strip of a photograph similar to, but I think not identical to, a line across the supplied one, possibly taken in the same session. The credit reads "Photo by Tom Coburn, Chronicle Staff".

The clipping is stamped with the date "SUN JAN 19 1969", presumably the date of publication.

The "65 bones now owned by the museum" presumably refer to CM 662, aka. CMNH 10670, aka. HMNS 175. I should have wondered long ago how the Houston Museum sources the casts to fill out their skeleton to a complete mount, and this is a route that I now need to follow.
